    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p> Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.

        In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that way, not with this method.
        
        Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken with sauce and cheese. The key to great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a little bit of sauce on top, so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your chicken Parmesan, that's fine, you can always serve extra sauce on the side. I also use some actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously, most versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh mozzarella, tangy Provolone and real Parmesan.
        
        Another little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, which adds another layer of flavor. You'll fry the breadcrumb and Parmesan crusted chicken breasts just to golden brown before transferring them to a baking pan and adding sauce (but not too much!), cheese, and herbs. Okay, now let's break it down. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Chicken Breast</li>
        <li>Onion & Garlic</li>
        <li>Tomato Products</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Spices & Seasonings</li>
        <li>Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Cheeses</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil</li>

    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees</li>
        <li>Filet chicken breasts so they are thinner</li>
        <li>Pound out chicken breast if need be</li>
        <li>Season the chicken.</li>
        <li>Beat your eggs in a bowl and pour your breadcrumbs into another dish.</li>
        <li>Take your chicken breast and dip it in the egg, pick it up from the egg mixture and let it drip the excess off, then into the breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Completely cover the cutlet in the breadcrumbs, even pressing down to make sure it adheres.</li>
        <li>Take your finished cutlets and put them to the side</li>
        <li>While you get your grove, heat up olive oil in a skillet and get ready to start frying.</li>
        <li>In 3-4 minutes your oil should be hot enough, place 2-3 cutlets into the pan away from you to avoid splatters.</li>
        <li>Fry until golden brown on both sides, put to side and finish frying all the cutlets.</li>
        <li>Only do two to three at a time to not overcrown the pan and reduce the tempurature of the frying oil.</li>
        <li>Place a small amount of your tomato sauce on the bottom of your baking dish</li>
        <li>Lay out your chicken cutlets onto the dish making sure they don't overlap, use multiple dishes if need be.</li>
        <li>Cover your cutlets with your assortment of cheeses and tomato sauce, layering them as you go.</li>
        <li>I like to switch my oven from 450 to Broil and stick my cutlets underneath the Broiler and keep an eye on them so they turn out perfect and golden brown while remaining crispy.</li>
        <li>Enjoy</li>
    </ol>
